# What is Augmented Reality?

My current take on the Augmented Reality space after working in it for the past three years. 

[Presentation: What is Augmented Reality](https://slides.com/brentlong/what-is-augmented-reality)

I recently gave this presentation at [HackAR](https://www.meetup.com/hackAR-SF/). If you're in the San Francisco area, definitely consider stopping by. We'll be creating things together in the AR space with all kinds of interesting tech (Google Tango, Leap Motion, OpenBCI, Unity, Blippar, Meta, ODG, and a bunch more).
